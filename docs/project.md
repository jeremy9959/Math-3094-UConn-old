# First Project Assignment

## Overview

For your first project, please choose one or more of the algorithms we have discussed so far:

- Linear Regression
- Naive Bayes Classification (Bernoulli or Binomial model)
- Logistic Regression

as well as other methods that we will discuss in the next few weeks,
together with Gradient Descent or Newton's Method (if appropriate) and apply these techniques
to obtain information from a data set of your choice.

You may work individually or in groups of two or three.

Your project should be presented as a Jupyter notebook that includes a thorough
explanation of your work together with any code that you work with and any results that
you obtain.

If you need a place to start, you could pick one of the labs we have done and develop
the ideas there in more depth or using different data.

We suggest meeting with you to discuss your plans before you get too far along.

The project will be due March 22, 2021.

## Datasets
